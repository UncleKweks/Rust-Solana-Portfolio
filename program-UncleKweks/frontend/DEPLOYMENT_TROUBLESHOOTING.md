# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Blank Page Issue After Wallet Connection

If you're experiencing a blank page after connecting to Phantom wallet on Vercel, follow these troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Immediate Debugging Steps

#### Enable Debug Panel
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` (or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) to toggle the debug panel
- Check the debug panel for any error messages or wallet state issues
- Look for localStorage availability and any console errors

#### Check Browser Console
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Look for any error messages, especially:
  - Solana wallet adapter errors
  - localStorage access errors
  - React rendering errors

### 2. Common Causes and Solutions

#### A. Wallet Connection State Issues
**Problem**: Wallet connects but app doesn't recognize the connection state
**Solution**: 
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Disconnect and reconnect wallet
- Check if wallet is on correct network (devnet)

#### B. localStorage Access Issues
**Problem**: App crashes when trying to access localStorage
**Solution**: 
- Check if localStorage is available in your browser
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Check browser privacy settings

#### C. Build Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Production build has different behavior than development
**Solution**:
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check Vite build configuration
- Verify environment variables

### 3. Environment-Specific Issues

#### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Usually works fine
- **Production**: May have different behavior due to:
  - Minification
  - Bundle splitting
  - Environment variables
  - CORS policies

#### Browser Compatibility
- Test in different browsers
- Check for browser-specific wallet support
- Verify Web3 compatibility

### 4. Vercel-Specific Solutions

#### A. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

#### B. Build Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

#### C. Vercel Configuration
The `vercel.json` file handles:
- SPA routing (prevents 404s)
- Security headers
- Build optimization

### 5. Code-Level Fixes Applied

#### Error Boundaries
- Added React Error Boundaries to catch and display errors
- Prevents complete app crashes
- Shows user-friendly error messages

#### Safe localStorage Operations
- Wrapped localStorage access in try-catch blocks
- Graceful fallbacks when storage is unavailable
- Prevents crashes from storage access issues

#### Enhanced Wallet State Management
- Better handling of connecting/disconnecting states
- Improved error handling for wallet operations
- More robust state synchronization

#### Debug Panel
- Built-in debugging tools for production
- Real-time wallet state monitoring
- Error logging and display

### 6. Testing Steps

#### Local Testing
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Test the production build locally: `npm run preview`
3. Connect wallet and verify functionality

#### Vercel Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test wallet connection
3. Check debug panel for issues
4. Monitor console for errors

### 7. Advanced Debugging

#### Network Tab
- Check for failed API calls
- Verify Solana RPC endpoint accessibility
- Look for CORS issues

#### Application Tab
- Check localStorage contents
- Verify wallet connection state
- Monitor state changes

#### Performance Tab
- Check for memory leaks
- Monitor bundle loading
- Verify code splitting

### 8. Fallback Solutions

#### Graceful Degradation
- App continues to work even if some features fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

#### Alternative Storage
- Consider IndexedDB as localStorage alternative
- Implement memory-based fallbacks
- Use session storage for temporary data

### 9. Monitoring and Logging

#### Production Logging
- Console logs for debugging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring

#### User Feedback
- Clear error messages
- Loading states
- Success confirmations

### 10. Prevention Measures

#### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Comprehensive error handling

#### Testing
- Unit tests for critical functions
- Integration tests for wallet flows
- End-to-end testing

#### Documentation
- Clear setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guides
- Known issues and solutions

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify wallet network (devnet)
- [ ] Test in incognito mode
- [ ] Check localStorage availability
- [ ] Verify Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Test local production build
- [ ] Check debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- [ ] Monitor network requests
- [ ] Verify wallet connection state

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the debug panel output
2. Review browser console errors
3. Test in different browsers
4. Verify wallet compatibility
5. Check Vercel deployment logs
6. Review recent code changes

## Common Error Messages

- **"Wallet not connected"**: Check wallet connection state
- **"localStorage not available"**: Browser privacy settings or storage issues
- **"Failed to fetch"**: Network or RPC endpoint issues
- **"Transaction failed"**: Solana network or wallet issues
- **"Component error"**: React rendering or state management issues
